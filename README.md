# Email_Spam_Classifier
The email spam classifier is a machine learning project designed to automatically classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (non-spam) messages. With the increasing volume of unsolicited and unwanted emails, this project aims to provide an efficient solution to filter out spam emails and prioritize genuine communication.
